# Scraper for Google Play - Project Game Addiction Termonology

This scraper was created for a research project that will try to define terms that might be related to Game Addiction. Comments are scraped in Brazilian Portuguese. 
I've extended previous scraper as Google Play changed its API after 2020.

My work is based on the current *play-scraper* and *google-play-scraper* libraries for python.

Code is written in Python 3.6.
